# Neovim repository

This repo is for tracking current changes to my neovim config. 
Eventually this will all be moved into my RCfiles repository 
along side all my other configs, but it will be slower to develop 
there since the neovim config adds new files often and I would 
then need to do the file linking whenever I add something new.

The other big purpose here is to test git plugins on files as I'm
developing them.
